# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH - EIP712 signatures

Sign & verify using the [EIP712 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712). Built with 🏗 [Scaffold-ETH](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth)

First, you'll sign a message:

![eip712](.github/images/1.png)

You can find the front-end code in `packages/react-app/src/views/SignMessage.jsx`.

The signed message will be verified and stored by the back-end server. Check `packages/backend/index.js`

Once you send a valid signed message, you can attempt a replay attack:
